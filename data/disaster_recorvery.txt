You can synchronise your systems/applications to the C2 platform through a variety of methods such as direct uploads, SFTP, API connection, or manual creation within the tool itself.
Systems can be uploaded individually or grouped within associated IT Services. The naming conventions for systems and their parent groups are completely flexible and can be changed
to suit your organisation.

Understanding the organisation need on IT

During the Business Impact Analysis the organisational need on IT is discovered. The BIA ensures that this business need is qualified to a rigorous level and entirely within the context of
the Minimum Business Continuity Objective (MBCO), therefore only registers systems dependencies which are required to mitigate intolerable harm to the business. The C2 system can
then compare the IT RPOs and RTOs registered against the systems with the business need and flag conflicts in the analysis. This happens in real time within the BIA and SIA as well
as being available in report form
for distribution.

An in depth Systems Impact Analysis is conducted based on the scope of your DR plans. Within the plan, ownership of each system is assigned to a contact within your organisation. The
SIA is then distributed to all owners to be completed. All aspects of the SIA are completely configurable within the administration meaning you can capture the detail you require inline
with your organisations terminology. However C2's default setting is configured to meet recognised industry standards out of the box.

The C2 BCMS allows you to create smart IT Disaster Recovery plans and work instructions that are dynamically populated from the data gathered through your Systems Impact Analysis
(SIA), incident checklists/runbooks, and chosen IMT. The call list for each plan is also automatically generated by the system. In addition to the automatically built plans you can also
include any associated documentation that would be useful during an event.

From the Policy Management facility you can apply policies to your IT DR plans based on the RTO of the plan (the plan RTO is taken from the lowest RTO of any system within that plan).
This poliy can automate the template the plan must use, the review frequency or the plan and BIA, what exercise/tests need to be performed and at what frequency.

During the BIA & SIA gaps between the business need and current IT commitments are identified and risks are raised to the central register. The risks are automatically populated with
the potential organisational impact as well as key data that will allow the responsible risk owners to immediately assess the risk. All risks that have been identified within a DR plan will be
available on the plan level risk register accessible via the plan dashboard.
