I am a company called Continuity2.

About Continuity2 -

Our Story
C2 was founded nearly 2 decades ago by our CEO Richard McGlave who at the time was a high level business continuity practitioner within Scottish Power. During Richard's career both he and his fellow industry colleagues had struggled to find any sort of workable solution to the real world processes required for the efficient and effective management of a comprehensive Business Continuity System. There simply was not a single software product on the market that fully fulfilled the needs of working BC professionals. Frustrated by the lacklustre solutions available Richard turned his dismay to inspiration with the goal of revolutionising the practice of business continuity. With a wife and two young children at home Richard took the massive risk of quitting his career and went out on his own. In 2002 working from a 4x5 office in Edinburgh with nothing more than a desk, chair, and a server in a cupboard Richard started Continuity2. Since then the company has grown exponentially and now services some of the worlds largest organisations making their practice of Business Continuity easier each day.

At C2 today we strive to provide intuitive and innovative solutions for the business resilience market and reshape the industry as we know it today. So it's safe to say our values have never changed in 16 years and no matter our successes we will never stop striving to be better. It is our promise to you, that an investment in C2 is an investment in always being at the cutting edge of business resilience technologies and best practice.

WORLD LEADING BUSINESS CONTINUITY SOFTWARE


Why Continuity2 And Why Our Software Delivers
Need ISO certification as a guarantee? Want to implement a comprehensive BC programme and achieve organisational wide buy-in without the requirement to have to train multiple members of staff? Need detailed reporting that can be navigated and generated at the speed of thought? At C2 we give you it all and more in a simple, efficient, effective business continuity management software product that makes your job easier.

In a world where business disruptions are an everyday occurrence, it's critical to make sure you have business continuity plans in place to ensure your organisation can recover to its full working capacity as quickly as it takes to read this blurb.... This is not a drill. According to the IBHS 25% of businesses that suffer a disaster never reopen, for companies that do not recover within 1 month that number increases to a staggering 80% (Bernstein Crisis Management).

Continuity2 has been empowering the resilience of organisations across the world for the past 20 years, we know this discipline inside-out, and our CEO even helped standardise it (BS25999 & ISO 22301). But it's not just our knowledge of BC that separates us from the market, it's our attention-to-detail UX Designers working every day to make your job easier, it's our boffin developers keeping C2 on the cutting edge of industry technologies and ensuring you can do your job faster each day, and our dedicated service delivery team guaranteeing you feel constantly supported at all times. So it goes without saying we believe our BCM Software is simply the best offering on the market. But don't just take our word for it, book a demo today and see for yourself.
