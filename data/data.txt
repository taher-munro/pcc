I am a company called Continuity2.

About Continuity2 -

Our Story
C2 was founded nearly 2 decades ago by our CEO Richard McGlave who at the time was a high level business continuity practitioner within Scottish Power. During Richard's career both he and his fellow industry colleagues had struggled to find any sort of workable solution to the real world processes required for the efficient and effective management of a comprehensive Business Continuity System. There simply was not a single software product on the market that fully fulfilled the needs of working BC professionals. Frustrated by the lacklustre solutions available Richard turned his dismay to inspiration with the goal of revolutionising the practice of business continuity. With a wife and two young children at home Richard took the massive risk of quitting his career and went out on his own. In 2002 working from a 4x5 office in Edinburgh with nothing more than a desk, chair, and a server in a cupboard Richard started Continuity2. Since then the company has grown exponentially and now services some of the worlds largest organisations making their practice of Business Continuity easier each day.

At C2 today we strive to provide intuitive and innovative solutions for the business resilience market and reshape the industry as we know it today. So it's safe to say our values have never changed in 16 years and no matter our successes we will never stop striving to be better. It is our promise to you, that an investment in C2 is an investment in always being at the cutting edge of business resilience technologies and best practice.

Overview of Meridian BCMS 

 

The Meridian BCMS software is a secure web-based tool designed to alleviate and assist with the day to day management of an Organisation’s BCMS.  

The tooling is consistent with many, if not all, of the requirements of good practice in Business Continuity Management ISO 22301.  The tool is an integrated BC Quality Management System:  

 

Meridian BCMS allows you to create, store, manage and distribute business continuity Plans.  The scheduling and carrying out of Exercises is simple with results reported via the system. In the event of an incident you can contact key personnel or groups of staff via 2-way SMS, voice calls, email and conference calling with real time reporting and tracking.  Continuity2 is committed to promoting best practice in Business Continuity Management and supporting this through its Business Continuity Software.   

 

Meridian BCMS delivers:  

Creating and managing business continuity plans  

Conducting business impact analysis 

Exercising of business continuity plans  

Policy or key performance indicators control 

Contacting / notification of personnel during incidents and exercises   

Maintaining and accessing vital records 

The provision of audit capability  

BC Risk Management  

MI and reporting 

The creation and tracking of corrective/ preventive actions  

Mobile notification and Plan Functionality 

 

Plan Management 

Plans can be created automatically by this system via a combination of the dynamic template capability (the ability to build templates and have them automatically read data from e.g. BIA, contact lists, systems lists, supplier lists etc.) Plans are automatically version controlled, reviewed, and distributed and signed off according to your change control procedures by the workflow.  Contact details are held in a central database for use in plans and call lists. Updates to contact details are applied and available immediately. Plan managers / coordinators have an intuitive dashboard to manage their plans from.   

We recognize that the plan, alone, may not be enough documentation in the even to of a BC incident. So, we provide an “Associated Documents” (‘Virtual Battle box’) facility to store associated documentation for each plan which may be used in the event of an incident. Changes to all plans across the enterprise can be performed simultaneously via the central administration.     

 

  

Efficiencies / Benefits   

Plans can be of any type (e.g. emergency procedures, business continuity plans, IT disaster recovery plans and crisis management plans).  During implementation, we will train your administrator/s on the use of the proprietary Continuity2 Template Creator and assist them with the creation of the initial templates to suit your organization.  Template changes are reflected across all documents associated to that template e.g. if a template has been used across 100s or 1000s of plans then any change to the template is reflected automatically across all the documents.  Templates can be aligned to recognsied BCM best practice e.g. Business Continuity Institute’s Good Practice Guidelines, Disaster Recovery Institute, ITIL and ISO 22301.  Business Impact analysis data is automatically input into plans. Indeed, in many cases the automated workflow can eliminate the need to develop BC plans in that the combination of the centrally driven template and integration to BIA information provides 100% of plan content.  For BIA see below:  

 

Business Impact Analysis 

The Business Impact Analysis module is intuitive and follows best practice and International Standard e.g. ISO27001 requirements: BIA’s are integrated into the system and can be carried out at all points of the enterprise e.g.  Organisational, Directorate / Business Unit and / or Service / Functional levels.  

The BIA identifies Key Products and Services and their supporting activities. The activities are analysed under the organization’s criteria for impact analysis i.e. the system is configurable via the BIA administration function within the system to reflect the organisation’s criteria for analysis.  

Critical activities are identified together with their supporting resources, dependencies and recovery requirements. This data is automatically made available to plans thereby providing the basis for plan content. Consolidated BIA data is produced in the form of PDF / word reports which can be automatically sent for review and sign off.  BIA/Risk Analysis is integrated completely within the software.  

Efficiencies / Benefits   

The BIA is facilitated via an online wizard where responders / participants answer questions regarding their activity / service.  The data is captured with the system as required by the organisation, and thereafter is available for reporting and planning purposes.  Responders require no training and are generally not users of the system.  Their participation is facilitated via email linking them to their specific analysis which takes on average 30 minutes to complete on the 1st pass of the BIA and 10 – 15 minutes to review thereafter (normally annually).   The combined participation of the responders provides core planning data without the need for workshops / interviews and extensive proforma exercises.  

Plan Exercise Management 

 

We recognise that the exerting of plans is essential to the overall assurance process that we are capable of mitigating business interruption impact.  We also recognise that it would be great if the system would arrange these exercises i.e. set the frequency, type, objectives, invite participants and link to our incident management /plan notification module.  So, we developed the workflow that allows you as the organisation to set the importance of plans according to the impact they are mitigating.  This can either be referred to as policy or key performance indicators. Either way, the Exercising module creates the exercise types per the organisation’s preference and the policy which the plan is subject to, schedules the exercise (as per the policy), invites the participants, defines the exercise objectives and emails the details to the participants. On completion of the exercise the system reports on the observations of the exercise and tracks recommendations and actions raised as a result of the exercise. All exercise reports can be distributed and signed off via the system and held within the system for Audit purposes.  

 

Efficiencies / Benefits 

The capability of the system to automatically create the exercise schedules, at your appetite, results in a massive time saving on: Organizing exercising schedules, communicating where when what, training of plan mangers on how to organize their exercises i.e. there is no effort on these tasks as the system automatically does them.         

 

Policy or key performance indicators control 

  

As discussed in the exercise management section, we have developed the workflow engine that allows you as the organisation to set the importance of plans according to the impact they are mitigating.  This is a fantastic time / user training saving i.e. as an administrator you can decide what the frequency of BIA, Plan, Exercise, Training reviews are, and the system will automatically manage all of this for you and report the progress to the management information dashboard.         

Management Information 

Meridian BCMS includes a fully functional Management Information module that reports on e.g. the currency of BIAs, Plans, Exercises and Communication.  The system produces graphical views of performance and downloadable management reports.  This function allows organizations to set metrics for performance of their BCMS and measure progress against BCMS objectives.  

Reports can be produced at any level within the organisation e.g. Organisational, Regional, Country, Business Unit, Business Function etc.  

   

Efficiencies / Benefits   

The system requires no user effort to compile the management information other than clicking the MI button to view the graphical data and download the reports. This interface is often the focal point of steering group meetings and discussion as it provides a real-time view of the health of the management system without the need for extensive pre-meeting preparation.  You can view performance at any level of the system provides reports in PDF and Word to support all MI.  Report can be sent to stakeholders automatically at the desired frequency.     

 

Plan Incident and Notification Management 

  

The system has a fully functional Notification / Incident Management capability including two-way SMS, Voice Messaging, Action Creation / Tracking, and Call Conferencing. The Incident Management system enables the team controlling the incident to call out and stay in touch with people during incidents. The system allows the communication with individuals, recovery teams and others in the enterprise as needed.  The technology built into the system allows for the setting up of web-based incident pages and task lists where stakeholders can be kept up to date on incident status via push or pull messages through email including mobile devices. 

 

The system also has a mobile interface that works on any browser compatible smart phone e.g. Android, iPhone, and Blackberry.  The mobile interface allows users to view plans, view associated documents, view check lists, communicate with team members, conduct conference calls, send SMS and send Text to Voice messages.    

 

Efficiencies / Benefits   

The integral communication capabilities and data interfaces within the system allow for efficient collation of contact data and execution of communications during incidents. The updating of contact details and keeping call lists up to date can be time consuming; the system provides the ability for call lists to be maintained with a minimum level of effort to the extent that the system will build and maintain call lists automatically as a result of data import or SFTP automation.  Whatever method is chosen by an organisation; the system negates the need for administrators to build and maintain call lists. 

 

Additional Call lists  

Essentially this gives our clients the ability to create notification lists for anything within their organisation.  Unlike  plan incident notification, there does not need to be a plan present i.e. you can create notifications for any locations, functions, departments, groups of people, specific project etc. etc.        

  

Risk Management 

Risk Register to level view  

  

Individual risk view  

  

Risk Administration  

 

The C2 RM module allows you to design your own approach to BC risk and maintain risk assessments and risk registers throughout the organisation.  This module is and will continually be developed to provide users with the ability to control Resilience Risk across the organisation.        

Corrective Action Tracking 

Meridian BCMS includes a fully functional corrective action tracking system which can be used to track all corrective actions associated to the management system e.g. actions from audits, exercises, BIA, etc.     

  

Efficiencies / Benefits   

If desired the system enables the raising, reporting and tracking of all corrective actions automatically sending and receiving of updates on status and requests for closure.  It is fully compliant with ISO requirements for corrective action.     

Internal auditing 

Internal auditing of the organisation’s BCMS can be conducted via the setting of audit questions and the delivery of questions to participants in the audit via an online interface.  The interface allows participants to respond to the audit and provide evidence to support their responses to the audit.  The system provides an effective method of conducting audits with minimal effort and is compliant to quality management systems requirements e.g. ISO 22301 ISO 27001: 

Creation  

  

Scoring   

Surveys can be executed and reported on via the system to provide assurance to management of e.g. BC capabilities, Supply Chain Analysis, Requirements Reviews etc. 

Efficiencies / Benefits   

The system provides ability to audit the BCMS with minimal effort i.e. instead of utilising a rolling audit programme (2, 3 years) with the subsequent interviews and meetings.  Audits can be carried out within a 2 / 3 week lapsed time with 3 / 4 days efforts.  Audits are saved and can be reused / edited for future use thus saving on preparation time. 

     

Mobile Functionality  

                              

Meridian BCMS allows true seamless high availability of BC plans through your own mobile technology.  Our app synchronizes with your live data enabling you or indeed any member of your incident management team to view plans and strategies, call trees, battlebox and other associated documents whilst on the move.  The mobile application negates the old requirements for "hard copy" BCPs, enhancing information security protocols by ensuring that everyone has access to the right information, right when they need it.  The mobile app adds another layer of protection by ensuring that, should your Meridian BCMS tool be offline, your critical information is still available.  

Efficiencies / Benefits   

Speed of response is critical in an incident. By providing immediate access to your plans, call tree information and crisis communication mechanisms, you are minimising potentially negative impacts on your brand and reputation by projecting a confident public image as a result of a collaborative, coordinated and, importantly, swift response. The app (available for iPhone or Android) provides the ability to view plans, battle box files or essential controlled documents (plans, maps etc.) as well as initiating your crisis or incident response via SMS or email.  A key feature is the ability to undertake a "recovery team" pull conference call, without the need for dial in numbers, pins or passwords. 

Reports 

  

The application comes with the ability to run dynamic reports than can be used to inform management either in the daily management of business continuity or incidents e.g.: Tell me -  

what processes are affected by the loss of this system,  

what services / process are affected by the loss of this site,  

what resources are required to recover this process 

the number of staff that can work from home in this location  

the number of staff that require alternative working arrangements 

the number of phones, PCs, Desks, Laptop required  

the application required over time required to support this specific incident  

Reports are in PDF and or Excel formats.  

Efficiencies / Benefits   

In that BIA data is collated and maintained efficiently it can be scrutinised to provide dynamic reports as detailed above. This eliminates the need to scrutinise documentation (e.g. reports and spreadsheets) manually and extrapolate information on a manual basis.    

 

Document Management System 

   

In Addition to Plan document control, the system provides a full document management system for all BCMS documentation under change control e.g. Policy, Methodologies, Reports, Minutes to meetings, Training Records etc.  

The Document control function allows users to set the parameters for reminder emails to be sent for the review and sign-off of documents, as well as being able to monitor at what stage a document is in within the review / sign off process.  Document control displays the review and sign off status of Plans, BIAs, Exercises and BCMS documents within the application and can be viewed by document type as well as document type within Business unit. 

 

Efficiencies / Benefits   

The system provides an efficient workflow that traces all documentation and maintains the currency of documentation via the Web-service. Once documents are uploaded and assigned to the system there is no requirement for user intervention. Interventions are only required when the workflow for a document is interrupted e.g. an author leaves the organisation, a signoff date is missed.  This is flagged to the administration who can reallocate the authorship to another contact with ease.

From this screen you can create, edit and delete IBS(s) as well as their child service processes. IBSIA Management also acts as your tool to assign ownership of services and the distribution of Important Business Service Impact Analysis (IBSIA). The analysis is connected to each service process and all data is aggregated to it’s parent IBS. You can also take advantage of our centralisation features within the IBSIA. This allows you to answer steps of the IBSIA centrally (by the system administator) e.g the service description and only assign out specific steps to your service owners to answer individually. 3 FCA Compliance Running IBS Impact Analysis (IBSIA) 4 IBS Impact Analysis (IBSIA) The IBS Impact anaylsis can either be run directly from IBSIA Management by the logged in System Administrator, distributed via email to be conducted by the assigned service owner, or conducted by a service plan owner from within the IBS Plan Management module (should you decide to create IBS Continuity Plans). When distributed the IBS Impact Analysis is accessed by the service owner via an email link. The service owner will then be presented with a dedicated landing page full of helpful information that will guide them through the analysis itself. As a System Administrator you will be able to control the content which is presented to the service owner on this landing page via the IBSIA Adminstration. IBSIA Administration also allows you to completely configure the IBSIA to your organisations requirements for analysis. When the service owner proceeds to the IBSIA they will reach the IBSIA dashboard where they can see the analysis is broken down into 5 easy digestible steps. The service owner will also be able to clearly see their progress against each step from this area. Each analysis step itself is broken into smaller sections (if necessary) and each section has it’s owner dedicated help to guide the owner throughout the analysis onto completion / final submission. Your Screen Here BCMS | Natwest Secure https://natwest.continuity2.com FCA Compliance IBS Impact Analysis (IBSIA) 5 Description of Service The first step of the IBSIA allows the Service Owner to provide a detailed description of the service, As well as this the owner can also provide information of any steps that may be involved within the service itself. BCMS | Natwest Secure https://natwest.continuity2.com Your Screen Here FCA Compliance IBS Impact Analysis (IBSIA) 6 Capture Tolerances The next two steps of the IBSIA allow the service owners to assess their services impact againsts impact categories decided by the organisation. For the purpose of the demo we have outlined these as ‘Consumer Harm’, ‘Impact on the Organisation’, and ‘Impact on the UK Financial System’ as per the FCA guidelines. However is you wish to assess to a more detailed level of categorisation you can do so via the IBSIA Administration. The impact timeline, levels, descriptions and tolerances are also completely configurable. Guidance documentation can also be uploaded into the step as well as the standard inbuilt help feature. Qualitative explanations are collected from every entry to the matrix. The earliest point in the timeline in which the criticality tolerance is breached is then passed onto the next step and set as the ‘Service Tolerance’. The ‘Service Tolerance’ provides the context for the ‘Service Continuity Objective’ by detailing the maximum time that the service can be disrupted before it becomes unacceptable. The service owner is then offered the chance to provide detail, if applicable, on a minimum service continuity objective (MSCO) that the service could return to which would allow the service to function past its tolerance. A recovery time objective is also requested and how long the service could operate at the MSCO before tolerance would be breached.

These include supporting business activities/processes, services, people, property, technology, and 3rd party suppliers. Upon entering a new dependency the service owner is reminded of their MSCO and to confirm they believe that dependency is critical within that context. Owners then have the opportunity to declare the nature of dependency and any workarounds that may be available as well as that workaround duration of effectiveness.

BCMS | Natwest Secure https://natwest.continuity2.com Your Screen Here FCA Compliance Service Consideration During BIA 10 BIA - Service Provision As well as the ability to meet the FCA’s guidelines through a direct analysis of your Important Business Services the C2 system also gives the ability to build upon your Business Impact Analysis and traditiional Business Continuity Planning. Through the addition of the Service Provision step in the BIA, an intuitive interface that lets activity owners consider which IBS they effect, you can map supporting activities to your IBS. This then allows activity owners to consider you IBS minimum service continuity objective and ensure they are available within any dependent IBS recovery time objective - thus creating a synergy between your business continuity and service continuity planning. Not only that but it means your IBS can now automatically inherit the critical dependencies of its supporting activities drastically cutting down the time required for service owners to complete their Important Business Service Impact Analysis. BCMS | Natwest Secure https://natwest.continuity2.com Your Screen Here FCA Compliance Creating IBS Continuity Plans 11 IBS Plan Management Within the FCA Compliance module you can easily create dedicated IBS Continuity Plans. These plans are completely flexible allowing you to create service plans for one or many IBS, IBS by groups, IBS by location or even a complete company wide IBSCP should you require this. As well as manually creating IBSCPs the system also has the capability to automatically build service plans covering all supporting business activities (if you also conduct BIAs within the system). With these smart plans you simply select which IBS(s) you wish to cover and the system will automatically build a plan containing every part of your organisation that IBS(s) relies on to function at it’s minimum service continuity objective. These plans will be synced to your traditional BCPs meaning they will be updated automatically as and when you review your business continuity plans. This means you will have accurate up to date IBSCPs at absolutely no extra cost to your business continuity programme. BCMS | Natwest Secure https://natwest.continuity2.com Your Screen Here FCA Compliance Creating IBS RIsks 12 IBS Risk Management The FCA Compliance module also comes with a dedicated risk register for all risks raised within the system related to your important business services. You can create service related risks direct from this area, or throughout the entire application including your IBS Plans, IBSIA, BIA, IBS Self Assessment, Scenario & Resource Mapping, Exercise & Testing and more. All IBS related risks also show on the global risk register and against any other applicable registers your have created (business unit registers etc).

During the Business Impact Analysis the organisational need on IT is discovered. The BIA ensures that this business need is qualified to a rigorous level and entirely within the context of
the Minimum Business Continuity Objective (MBCO), therefore only registers systems dependencies which are required to mitigate intolerable harm to the business. The C2 system can
then compare the IT RPOs and RTOs registered against the systems with the business need and flag conflicts in the analysis. This happens in real time within the BIA and SIA as well
as being available in report form
for distribution.

An in depth Systems Impact Analysis is conducted based on the scope of your DR plans. Within the plan, ownership of each system is assigned to a contact within your organisation. The
SIA is then distributed to all owners to be completed. All aspects of the SIA are completely configurable within the administration meaning you can capture the detail you require inline
with your organisations terminology. However C2's default setting is configured to meet recognised industry standards out of the box.

Overview of Meridian BCMS 

 

The Meridian BCMS software is a secure web-based tool designed to alleviate and assist with the day to day management of an Organisation’s BCMS.  

The tooling is consistent with many, if not all, of the requirements of good practice in Business Continuity Management ISO 22301.  The tool is an integrated BC Quality Management System:  

 

Meridian BCMS allows you to create, store, manage and distribute business continuity Plans.  The scheduling and carrying out of Exercises is simple with results reported via the system. In the event of an incident you can contact key personnel or groups of staff via 2-way SMS, voice calls, email and conference calling with real time reporting and tracking.  Continuity2 is committed to promoting best practice in Business Continuity Management and supporting this through its Business Continuity Software.   

 

Meridian BCMS delivers:  

Creating and managing business continuity plans  

Conducting business impact analysis 

Exercising of business continuity plans  

Policy or key performance indicators control 

Contacting / notification of personnel during incidents and exercises   

Maintaining and accessing vital records 

The provision of audit capability  

BC Risk Management  

MI and reporting 

The creation and tracking of corrective/ preventive actions  

Mobile notification and Plan Functionality 

 

Plan Management 

Plans can be created automatically by this system via a combination of the dynamic template capability (the ability to build templates and have them automatically read data from e.g. BIA, contact lists, systems lists, supplier lists etc.) Plans are automatically version controlled, reviewed, and distributed and signed off according to your change control procedures by the workflow.  Contact details are held in a central database for use in plans and call lists. Updates to contact details are applied and available immediately. Plan managers / coordinators have an intuitive dashboard to manage their plans from.   

We recognize that the plan, alone, may not be enough documentation in the even to of a BC incident. So, we provide an “Associated Documents” (‘Virtual Battle box’) facility to store associated documentation for each plan which may be used in the event of an incident. Changes to all plans across the enterprise can be performed simultaneously via the central administration.     

 

  

Efficiencies / Benefits   

Plans can be of any type (e.g. emergency procedures, business continuity plans, IT disaster recovery plans and crisis management plans).  During implementation, we will train your administrator/s on the use of the proprietary Continuity2 Template Creator and assist them with the creation of the initial templates to suit your organization.  Template changes are reflected across all documents associated to that template e.g. if a template has been used across 100s or 1000s of plans then any change to the template is reflected automatically across all the documents.  Templates can be aligned to recognsied BCM best practice e.g. Business Continuity Institute’s Good Practice Guidelines, Disaster Recovery Institute, ITIL and ISO 22301.  Business Impact analysis data is automatically input into plans. Indeed, in many cases the automated workflow can eliminate the need to develop BC plans in that the combination of the centrally driven template and integration to BIA information provides 100% of plan content.  For BIA see below:  

 

Business Impact Analysis 

The Business Impact Analysis module is intuitive and follows best practice and International Standard e.g. ISO27001 requirements: BIA’s are integrated into the system and can be carried out at all points of the enterprise e.g.  Organisational, Directorate / Business Unit and / or Service / Functional levels.  

The BIA identifies Key Products and Services and their supporting activities. The activities are analysed under the organization’s criteria for impact analysis i.e. the system is configurable via the BIA administration function within the system to reflect the organisation’s criteria for analysis.  

Critical activities are identified together with their supporting resources, dependencies and recovery requirements. This data is automatically made available to plans thereby providing the basis for plan content. Consolidated BIA data is produced in the form of PDF / word reports which can be automatically sent for review and sign off.  BIA/Risk Analysis is integrated completely within the software.  

Efficiencies / Benefits   

The BIA is facilitated via an online wizard where responders / participants answer questions regarding their activity / service.  The data is captured with the system as required by the organisation, and thereafter is available for reporting and planning purposes.  Responders require no training and are generally not users of the system.  Their participation is facilitated via email linking them to their specific analysis which takes on average 30 minutes to complete on the 1st pass of the BIA and 10 – 15 minutes to review thereafter (normally annually).   The combined participation of the responders provides core planning data without the need for workshops / interviews and extensive proforma exercises.  

Plan Exercise Management 

 

We recognise that the exerting of plans is essential to the overall assurance process that we are capable of mitigating business interruption impact.  We also recognise that it would be great if the system would arrange these exercises i.e. set the frequency, type, objectives, invite participants and link to our incident management /plan notification module.  So, we developed the workflow that allows you as the organisation to set the importance of plans according to the impact they are mitigating.  This can either be referred to as policy or key performance indicators. Either way, the Exercising module creates the exercise types per the organisation’s preference and the policy which the plan is subject to, schedules the exercise (as per the policy), invites the participants, defines the exercise objectives and emails the details to the participants. On completion of the exercise the system reports on the observations of the exercise and tracks recommendations and actions raised as a result of the exercise. All exercise reports can be distributed and signed off via the system and held within the system for Audit purposes.  

 

Efficiencies / Benefits 

The capability of the system to automatically create the exercise schedules, at your appetite, results in a massive time saving on: Organizing exercising schedules, communicating where when what, training of plan mangers on how to organize their exercises i.e. there is no effort on these tasks as the system automatically does them.         

 

Policy or key performance indicators control 

  

As discussed in the exercise management section, we have developed the workflow engine that allows you as the organisation to set the importance of plans according to the impact they are mitigating.  This is a fantastic time / user training saving i.e. as an administrator you can decide what the frequency of BIA, Plan, Exercise, Training reviews are, and the system will automatically manage all of this for you and report the progress to the management information dashboard.         

Management Information 

Meridian BCMS includes a fully functional Management Information module that reports on e.g. the currency of BIAs, Plans, Exercises and Communication.  The system produces graphical views of performance and downloadable management reports.  This function allows organizations to set metrics for performance of their BCMS and measure progress against BCMS objectives.  

Reports can be produced at any level within the organisation e.g. Organisational, Regional, Country, Business Unit, Business Function etc.  

   

Efficiencies / Benefits   

The system requires no user effort to compile the management information other than clicking the MI button to view the graphical data and download the reports. This interface is often the focal point of steering group meetings and discussion as it provides a real-time view of the health of the management system without the need for extensive pre-meeting preparation.  You can view performance at any level of the system provides reports in PDF and Word to support all MI.  Report can be sent to stakeholders automatically at the desired frequency.     

 

Plan Incident and Notification Management 

  

The system has a fully functional Notification / Incident Management capability including two-way SMS, Voice Messaging, Action Creation / Tracking, and Call Conferencing. The Incident Management system enables the team controlling the incident to call out and stay in touch with people during incidents. The system allows the communication with individuals, recovery teams and others in the enterprise as needed.  The technology built into the system allows for the setting up of web-based incident pages and task lists where stakeholders can be kept up to date on incident status via push or pull messages through email including mobile devices. 

 

The system also has a mobile interface that works on any browser compatible smart phone e.g. Android, iPhone, and Blackberry.  The mobile interface allows users to view plans, view associated documents, view check lists, communicate with team members, conduct conference calls, send SMS and send Text to Voice messages.    

 

Efficiencies / Benefits   

The integral communication capabilities and data interfaces within the system allow for efficient collation of contact data and execution of communications during incidents. The updating of contact details and keeping call lists up to date can be time consuming; the system provides the ability for call lists to be maintained with a minimum level of effort to the extent that the system will build and maintain call lists automatically as a result of data import or SFTP automation.  Whatever method is chosen by an organisation; the system negates the need for administrators to build and maintain call lists. 

 

Additional Call lists  

Essentially this gives our clients the ability to create notification lists for anything within their organisation.  Unlike  plan incident notification, there does not need to be a plan present i.e. you can create notifications for any locations, functions, departments, groups of people, specific project etc. etc.        

  

Risk Management 

Risk Register to level view  

  

Individual risk view  

  

Risk Administration  

 

The C2 RM module allows you to design your own approach to BC risk and maintain risk assessments and risk registers throughout the organisation.  This module is and will continually be developed to provide users with the ability to control Resilience Risk across the organisation.        

Corrective Action Tracking 

Meridian BCMS includes a fully functional corrective action tracking system which can be used to track all corrective actions associated to the management system e.g. actions from audits, exercises, BIA, etc.     

  

Efficiencies / Benefits   

If desired the system enables the raising, reporting and tracking of all corrective actions automatically sending and receiving of updates on status and requests for closure.  It is fully compliant with ISO requirements for corrective action.     

Internal auditing 

Internal auditing of the organisation’s BCMS can be conducted via the setting of audit questions and the delivery of questions to participants in the audit via an online interface.  The interface allows participants to respond to the audit and provide evidence to support their responses to the audit.  The system provides an effective method of conducting audits with minimal effort and is compliant to quality management systems requirements e.g. ISO 22301 ISO 27001: 

Creation  

  

Scoring   

Surveys can be executed and reported on via the system to provide assurance to management of e.g. BC capabilities, Supply Chain Analysis, Requirements Reviews etc. 

Efficiencies / Benefits   

The system provides ability to audit the BCMS with minimal effort i.e. instead of utilising a rolling audit programme (2, 3 years) with the subsequent interviews and meetings.  Audits can be carried out within a 2 / 3 week lapsed time with 3 / 4 days efforts.  Audits are saved and can be reused / edited for future use thus saving on preparation time. 

     

Mobile Functionality  

                              

Meridian BCMS allows true seamless high availability of BC plans through your own mobile technology.  Our app synchronizes with your live data enabling you or indeed any member of your incident management team to view plans and strategies, call trees, battlebox and other associated documents whilst on the move.  The mobile application negates the old requirements for "hard copy" BCPs, enhancing information security protocols by ensuring that everyone has access to the right information, right when they need it.  The mobile app adds another layer of protection by ensuring that, should your Meridian BCMS tool be offline, your critical information is still available.  

Efficiencies / Benefits   

Speed of response is critical in an incident. By providing immediate access to your plans, call tree information and crisis communication mechanisms, you are minimising potentially negative impacts on your brand and reputation by projecting a confident public image as a result of a collaborative, coordinated and, importantly, swift response. The app (available for iPhone or Android) provides the ability to view plans, battle box files or essential controlled documents (plans, maps etc.) as well as initiating your crisis or incident response via SMS or email.  A key feature is the ability to undertake a "recovery team" pull conference call, without the need for dial in numbers, pins or passwords. 

Reports 

  

The application comes with the ability to run dynamic reports than can be used to inform management either in the daily management of business continuity or incidents e.g.: Tell me -  

what processes are affected by the loss of this system,  

what services / process are affected by the loss of this site,  

what resources are required to recover this process 

the number of staff that can work from home in this location  

the number of staff that require alternative working arrangements 

the number of phones, PCs, Desks, Laptop required  

the application required over time required to support this specific incident  

Reports are in PDF and or Excel formats.  

Efficiencies / Benefits   

In that BIA data is collated and maintained efficiently it can be scrutinised to provide dynamic reports as detailed above. This eliminates the need to scrutinise documentation (e.g. reports and spreadsheets) manually and extrapolate information on a manual basis.    

 

Document Management System 

   

In Addition to Plan document control, the system provides a full document management system for all BCMS documentation under change control e.g. Policy, Methodologies, Reports, Minutes to meetings, Training Records etc.  

The Document control function allows users to set the parameters for reminder emails to be sent for the review and sign-off of documents, as well as being able to monitor at what stage a document is in within the review / sign off process.  Document control displays the review and sign off status of Plans, BIAs, Exercises and BCMS documents within the application and can be viewed by document type as well as document type within Business unit. 

 

Efficiencies / Benefits   

The system provides an efficient workflow that traces all documentation and maintains the currency of documentation via the Web-service. Once documents are uploaded and assigned to the system there is no requirement for user intervention. Interventions are only required when the workflow for a document is interrupted e.g. an author leaves the organisation, a signoff date is missed.  This is flagged to the administration who can reallocate the authorship to another contact with ease.

During the Business Impact Analysis the organisational need on IT is discovered. The BIA ensures that this business need is qualified to a rigorous level and entirely within the context of
the Minimum Business Continuity Objective (MBCO), therefore only registers systems dependencies which are required to mitigate intolerable harm to the business. The C2 system can
then compare the IT RPOs and RTOs registered against the systems with the business need and flag conflicts in the analysis. This happens in real time within the BIA and SIA as well
as being available in report form
for distribution.

During the BIA & SIA gaps between the business need and current IT commitments are identified and risks are raised to the central register. The risks are automatically populated with
the potential organisational impact as well as key data that will allow the responsible risk owners to immediately assess the risk. All risks that have been identified within a DR plan will be
available on the plan level risk register accessible via the plan dashboard.

From this screen you can create, edit and delete IBS(s) as well as their child service processes. IBSIA Management also acts as your tool to assign ownership of services and the distribution of Important Business Service Impact Analysis (IBSIA). The analysis is connected to each service process and all data is aggregated to it’s parent IBS. You can also take advantage of our centralisation features within the IBSIA. This allows you to answer steps of the IBSIA centrally (by the system administator) e.g the service description and only assign out specific steps to your service owners to answer individually. 3 FCA Compliance Running IBS Impact Analysis (IBSIA) 4 IBS Impact Analysis (IBSIA) The IBS Impact anaylsis can either be run directly from IBSIA Management by the logged in System Administrator, distributed via email to be conducted by the assigned service owner, or conducted by a service plan owner from within the IBS Plan Management module (should you decide to create IBS Continuity Plans). When distributed the IBS Impact Analysis is accessed by the service owner via an email link. The service owner will then be presented with a dedicated landing page full of helpful information that will guide them through the analysis itself. As a System Administrator you will be able to control the content which is presented to the service owner on this landing page via the IBSIA Adminstration. IBSIA Administration also allows you to completely configure the IBSIA to your organisations requirements for analysis. When the service owner proceeds to the IBSIA they will reach the IBSIA dashboard where they can see the analysis is broken down into 5 easy digestible steps. The service owner will also be able to clearly see their progress against each step from this area. Each analysis step itself is broken into smaller sections (if necessary) and each section has it’s owner dedicated help to guide the owner throughout the analysis onto completion / final submission. Your Screen Here BCMS | Natwest Secure https://natwest.continuity2.com FCA Compliance IBS Impact Analysis (IBSIA) 5 Description of Service The first step of the IBSIA allows the Service Owner to provide a detailed description of the service, As well as this the owner can also provide information of any steps that may be involved within the service itself. BCMS | Natwest Secure https://natwest.continuity2.com Your Screen Here FCA Compliance IBS Impact Analysis (IBSIA) 6 Capture Tolerances The next two steps of the IBSIA allow the service owners to assess their services impact againsts impact categories decided by the organisation. For the purpose of the demo we have outlined these as ‘Consumer Harm’, ‘Impact on the Organisation’, and ‘Impact on the UK Financial System’ as per the FCA guidelines. However is you wish to assess to a more detailed level of categorisation you can do so via the IBSIA Administration. The impact timeline, levels, descriptions and tolerances are also completely configurable. Guidance documentation can also be uploaded into the step as well as the standard inbuilt help feature. Qualitative explanations are collected from every entry to the matrix. The earliest point in the timeline in which the criticality tolerance is breached is then passed onto the next step and set as the ‘Service Tolerance’. The ‘Service Tolerance’ provides the context for the ‘Service Continuity Objective’ by detailing the maximum time that the service can be disrupted before it becomes unacceptable. The service owner is then offered the chance to provide detail, if applicable, on a minimum service continuity objective (MSCO) that the service could return to which would allow the service to function past its tolerance. A recovery time objective is also requested and how long the service could operate at the MSCO before tolerance would be breached. Your Screen Here BCMS | Natwest Secure https://natwest.continuity2.com Your Screen Here BCMS | Natwest Secure https://natwest.continuity2.com FCA Compliance IBS Impact Analysis (IBSIA) 7 Map critical service resources (dependencies) (property / people / systems / 3rd party suppliers / records & data) Within the critical dependencies step of the IBSIA the service owners have the ability to map all dependencies which are critical for their service to run at their minimum service continuity objective (MSCO). These include supporting business activities/processes, services, people, property, technology, and 3rd party suppliers. Upon entering a new dependency the service owner is reminded of their MSCO and to confirm they believe that dependency is critical within that context. Owners then have the opportunity to declare the nature of dependency and any workarounds that may be available as well as that workaround duration of effectiveness. Your Screen Here BCMS | Natwest Secure https://natwest.continuity2.com Your Screen Here BCMS | Natwest Secure https://natwest.continuity2.com FCA Compliance IBS Impact Analysis (IBSIA) 8 Map additional resources / resources over time The final step of the IBSIA allows the service owner to map critical resources / people they require to function at their MSCO. These resources can be mapped over time or in total. Again workarounds can be added in the event these resources are unavailable. BCMS | Natwest Secure https://natwest.continuity2.com Your Screen Here FCA Compliance Create and Run Plausible Scenarios 9 Scenario Administration & Resource Mapping The Scenario Administration & Resource Mapping module allows System Administrators (and any other user type you wish to make this module available to) access to every data point held within the system to create custom scenarios and report outputs. So whether you wish to know the impact of a loss of system(s), supplier(s), location(s), resource(s), or even combinations of any of the above, then the system can provide this to you at the click of a button. BCMS | Natwest Secure https://natwest.continuity2.com Your Screen Here FCA Compliance Service Consideration During BIA 10 BIA - Service Provision As well as the ability to meet the FCA’s guidelines through a direct analysis of your Important Business Services the C2 system also gives the ability to build upon your Business Impact Analysis and traditiional Business Continuity Planning. Through the addition of the Service Provision step in the BIA, an intuitive interface that lets activity owners consider which IBS they effect, you can map supporting activities to your IBS. This then allows activity owners to consider you IBS minimum service continuity objective and ensure they are available within any dependent IBS recovery time objective - thus creating a synergy between your business continuity and service continuity planning. Not only that but it means your IBS can now automatically inherit the critical dependencies of its supporting activities drastically cutting down the time required for service owners to complete their Important Business Service Impact Analysis. BCMS | Natwest Secure https://natwest.continuity2.com Your Screen Here FCA Compliance Creating IBS Continuity Plans 11 IBS Plan Management Within the FCA Compliance module you can easily create dedicated IBS Continuity Plans. These plans are completely flexible allowing you to create service plans for one or many IBS, IBS by groups, IBS by location or even a complete company wide IBSCP should you require this. As well as manually creating IBSCPs the system also has the capability to automatically build service plans covering all supporting business activities (if you also conduct BIAs within the system). With these smart plans you simply select which IBS(s) you wish to cover and the system will automatically build a plan containing every part of your organisation that IBS(s) relies on to function at it’s minimum service continuity objective. These plans will be synced to your traditional BCPs meaning they will be updated automatically as and when you review your business continuity plans. This means you will have accurate up to date IBSCPs at absolutely no extra cost to your business continuity programme. BCMS | Natwest Secure https://natwest.continuity2.com Your Screen Here FCA Compliance Creating IBS RIsks 12 IBS Risk Management The FCA Compliance module also comes with a dedicated risk register for all risks raised within the system related to your important business services. You can create service related risks direct from this area, or throughout the entire application including your IBS Plans, IBSIA, BIA, IBS Self Assessment, Scenario & Resource Mapping, Exercise & Testing and more. All IBS related risks also show on the global risk register and against any other applicable registers your have created (business unit registers etc). Your Screen Here BCMS | Natwest Secure https://natwest.continuity2.com Your Screen Here BCMS | Natwest Secure https://natwest.continuity2.com FCA Compliance Assessing Your Organisation Against The FCA Guidelines For Operational Resilience 13 IBS Self Assessment The IBS Self Assessment module allows you to create custom assessments / audits and distribute them to key business stakeholders or external organisations. Review frequencies can be set to regularly ensure you are complying to applicable standards/regulations and you can raise risks direct from the assessments as part of your continious improvement programme. The module also comes with an in-built FCA Operational Resilience assessment as standard. BCMS | Natwest Secure https://natwest.continuity2.com Your Screen Here FCA Compliance Viewing your IBS Continuity Performance 14 IBS MI Performance Dashboard With a vast array of elements to keep track of across your service continuity programme it is critical you have a central location that can provide a clear view of your current performance. The IBS MI Performance Dashboard provides you with a overarching view of your programme. See easily how your IBSIAs, IBS Plans, IBS Exercises, and IBS Self Assessments are performing against their review schedules. View all your risks and corrective actions and easily see if they are on track with their target resolution dates.

EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT C2
Our Story, Our Team

Continuity 2 Founded 2002 First company to integrate notification tool / services to proprietary platform2004First company to implement a full business continuity management approach (i.e Plan, Do, Check, Act)2007First company to develop BCMS mobile app2008Co-opted to ISO 22301 Panel2011First company to develop native mobile applications for android and IOS2013Launched new product MeridianBCMS - the worlds leading BCMS Software2018
Our Story
C2 was founded nearly 2 decades ago by our CEO Richard McGlave who at the time was a high level business continuity practitioner within Scottish Power. During Richard's career both he and his fellow industry colleagues had struggled to find any sort of workable solution to the real world processes required for the efficient and effective management of a comprehensive Business Continuity System. There simply was not a single software product on the market that fully fulfilled the needs of working BC professionals. Frustrated by the lacklustre solutions available Richard turned his dismay to inspiration with the goal of revolutionising the practice of business continuity. With a wife and two young children at home Richard took the massive risk of quitting his career and went out on his own. In 2002 working from a 4x5 office in Edinburgh with nothing more than a desk, chair, and a server in a cupboard Richard started Continuity2. Since then the company has grown exponentially and now services some of the worlds largest organisations making their practice of Business Continuity easier each day.

At C2 today we strive to provide intuitive and innovative solutions for the business resilience market and reshape the industry as we know it today. So it's safe to say our values have never changed in 16 years and no matter our successes we will never stop striving to be better. It is our promise to you, that an investment in C2 is an investment in always being at the cutting edge of business resilience technologies and best practice.

C2 Meridian: The Future of Operational Resilience
C2 Meridian is a web based tool (SaaS) designed to automate and assist the day to day management of an organisation's Operational Resilience & Business Continuity Management System (BCMS).

Our industry agnostic solution is completely configurable to meet your organisation's unique requirements. The system was created to ensure resilience professionals across the world are able to do their jobs better, faster, and easier.

One of the things I like about this application is the simplistic dashboard. The front end appears from sign-on and this can be tailored to suit user needs, so they only see what they need to see. Another key benefit is the provision of additional functionality that supports the Plans during validation and invocation. The benefit of having one system that can be configured to suit organisational complexity, provide Plan governance, has the ability to communicate to all Plan members, additional internal and external stakeholders using SMS, e-mail and forced voice call is a real plus.
